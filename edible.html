                        <p>A Mobile Application to reduce Food Waste and Save Money With our App, we are
                            delivering a solution that is special to the food sector out there; food items have a
                            shorter shelf life on behalf of the supplier, and the customer suffers a significant loss.
                            This application will assist them in listing their things that are about to expire and those
                            that have already expired and posting it, which is quite convenient with the app design, so
                            they can easily reach out to the consumer. Our application is not only focused on
                            supermarkets; we also have a face of the app dedicated to consumers, where they can search
                            for products and locate them. Some stores offer half-priced wane be expired products.</p>

                        <p>After we decided to make this app, we thought about what to name it. We came up with ideas
                            like "save food," "food recycle," "food waste," and "re-food." In the end, we decided that
                            "EDIBLE" was a better name and more reliable, and we made a logo of spoons and forks because
                            we thought it should be related to food.</p>

                        <p>The basic idea behind Edible is both to reduce food waste and to give people and the
                            marketplace in general, a platform to channel the food into homes and hands that are in
                            need. A lot of people have food that has expired or is about to get expired. And a lot of
                            people require food that they could get for free or at very subsidized rates. We planned to
                            bridge this gap and give the world a way to reduce food wastage and help each other out.
                            This idea seemed a better fit in terms of what we were trying to achieve. And we decided to
                            move forward with this. To achieve all of this, we pitched in the idea at a local grocery
                            store and it was well received. This idea checked all the design parameters which we had
                            laid out. It was useful, it was usable and it would be used. This was the signal to move
                            onwards.</p>
